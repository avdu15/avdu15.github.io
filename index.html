                        <p>Looking for something perfect for picnics, parties, or even as a special treat for yourself? These cookies are a great way to enjoy the classic flavors of strawberry cheesecake in a handheld, easy-to-eat form. They are super easy to make and come together in under an hour from start to finish which is unbelievable! They are perfect for any occasion from birthdays to holidays, these are a true crowd-pleaser! <br> Let's get started!!</p>

                        <h4>Recipe</h4>
                        <p> 1. Into a medium mixing bowl, add the softened cream cheese and powdered sugar, and mix with an electric hand mixer until well combined and smooth. <br> 2. Line a small baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 12 teaspoon of the cream cheese mixture on it. Freeze until harden for about 40+ minutes. <br> 3. Once the cream cheese filling is frozen, keep it in the freezer and start making the cookie dough. <br> 4. Into a big mixing bowl, add the room temperature butter, sugar, brown sugar, kosher salt, and vanilla extract, and cream it with an electric hand mixer for 2-3 minutes or until it's creamy and light in colour. <br> 5. Add the eggs, and mix until combined and creamy. <br> 6. Then, add the flour, and baking soda, and mix with the hand mixer until almost combined. <br> 7. Add the chopped strawberries and mix until just combined and there are no lumps of flour visible. Do not overmix. <br> 8. Use a large cookie scooper to scoop out the cookies or scoop the cookies with a regular tablespoon, 2 tablespoons at a time. Place them on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. <br> 9. Using your thumb or a teaspoon, make indents on each cookie. <br> 10. Remove the frozen cream cheese from the freezer and place each cream cheese piece in the indent you make in each cookie dough ball. <br> 11. Form the dough into a ball using your clean hands and bake in a 180c (350f) preheated oven for 12-14 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are light golden brown. Do not overbake them, we want to keep these cookies soft. <br> 12. Let the cookies cool for 5 minutes, and then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. </p>
                        
                        <h4>Some helpful tips...</h4>

                        <p>1. Use room temperature ingredients. It is important that you use room-temperature ingredients like eggs and butter. This step ensures that your mixture mixes into a homogenous mixture and bakes perfectly. <br>2. Don’t overmix the batter, you don’t want to develop the gluten in the flour. This step ensures you have moist cookies and not dense and dry cookies. <br>3. Use a cookies scoop to scoop out the cookies, that way you will have even-sized cookies, plus it ensures that your cookies bake evenly. <br>4. Make sure that your butter is at room temperature. An hour or two before making these cookies, take the butter out of the fridge and let it come to room temperature. The butter should be soft to the touch. If your butter is too cold, it will be harder to mix and there will be lumps of butter in the dough. <br>5. Measure your flour correctly! When measuring your flour, avoid scooping it with a measuring cup. Instead, stir the flour with a spoon to create as many air pockets as possible, and spoon it into your measuring cup. Finally, level it with a back of a knife. <br>6. Select fresh, ripe strawberries for the best flavor and texture. Avoid using overripe or underripe berries, as they can affect the overall quality of your cookies. <br>7. Line your sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat! This step helps the cookies to bake evenly, and it makes sure that your cookies release easily from the pan. <br>8. Be patient! I know it’s extremely tempting to eat these cookies as they are pulled out of the oven, but let these cookies cool for at least 15 minutes so they will be firmer and won’t crumble up. <br>9. We suggest letting these cookies cool for 5 minutes and then transferring them to a wire rack to cool for at least 10 more minutes. This step ensures that the bottom of your cookies will not be soggy from the steam.</p>
